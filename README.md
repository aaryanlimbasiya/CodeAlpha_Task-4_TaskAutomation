# CodeAlpha_Task-4_TaskAutomation
Here is my fourth task from CODEALPHA.

# Objective:

Identify a repetitive task in your workflow and create Python scripts to automate it. This could include tasks like file organization, data cleaning, or system maintenance.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One repetitive task that can be automated is data cleaning, particularly removing null values, duplicates, and standardizing column names in datasets. Hereâ€™s a Python script to automate this data cleaning process using pandas.

# Key Points:

Importing Libraries: The script uses the pandas library for data manipulation.

Loading Data: It reads the data from a CSV file into a DataFrame.

Dropping Null Values: It removes any rows with null values to ensure data completeness.

Removing Duplicates: It removes duplicate rows to avoid redundant data.

Standardizing Column Names: It converts all column names to lowercase and replaces spaces with underscores for consistency.

Saving Cleaned Data: It saves the cleaned data to a new CSV file.
